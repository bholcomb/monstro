# Monstro
C++ game UI library and editor.  Looking to try some experiments with something that is IMGUI like, but still themable and easy to use as an in-game UI.  Also looking to have an editor to help put together a UI.

Monstro is latin for "I show" (allegdly, Google said so, so it must be true)
